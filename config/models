-- These are our base CMIS object types.

-- The bare minimum is to have a document and folder.
-- They must have the following attributes:
--      localName, localNamespace, queryName, displayName, baseId, parentId,
--      description, creatable, fileable, queryable, controllablePolicy,
--      controllableACL, fulltextIndexed, includedInSupertypeQuery,
--      typeMutability.create, typeMutability.update, typeMutability.delete
